# IoTBystander
This repository aims to make the code and data of the research paper "IoTBystander: A Non-Intrusive Dual-Channel Based Smart Home Security Monitoring Framework." public.

# Note: Currently, the code and data have not been fully organized. We are actively working on the following tasks:

- Optimizing the code structure
- Sanitizing the data to remove privacy-sensitive information
- Addding detailed documentation

We expect to complete the initial version upon the publication of this paper and will continue to improve it over time.
